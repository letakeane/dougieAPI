  {id: 1, title: 'Sundown', description: "After arriving in Chicago, Korean War veteran Atticus Freeman discovers a letter from his missing father, Montrose, inviting him to discover his family legacy in Ardham, Massachusetts. Atticus, his uncle George (who writes a Green Book-style Black travel guide), and his friend Leti set off on a road trip to Devon County, Massachusetts. A group of murderous white men chase them out of the first town they stop in, but they escape thanks to the intervention of an unknown white woman, who somehow causes the mob's car to flip over. Soon after, they encounter the racist sheriff of Devon County, Eustice Hunt, who is eager to enforce the county's sundown law. Just after sunset, the sheriff's deputies force the travelers into the woods with the intent to lynch them, but the entire group is attacked by vicious monsters called shoggoths. Atticus, George and Leti fight their way out, while the police officers perish. The shoggoths are called away by a whistle. In the morning, the trio stumbles out of the woods to find an enormous mansion, where they are welcomed by a mysterious white man, William, who greets them warmly."},
  {id: 2, title: "Whitey's on the Moon", description: "William explains that the mansion is Ardham Lodge, designed by Titus Braithwhite, a slave trader and the founder of an occult secret society of wizards called the Sons of Adam. George realizes that Atticus is a descendant (through implied rape) of Titus and thus a premier member of the Sons. Because of this powerful heritage, Samuel Braithwhite, the current owner of the Lodge and leader of the Sons, plans to use – and potentially sacrifice – Atticus in an upcoming ritual. The white woman who helped the group earlier is revealed to be Samuel's daughter, Christina, who has a whistle that controls the monsters. After telling Atticus that not all white people are bad, she traps the travelers in their respective rooms with magic force fields. They eventually break out and rescue Montrose, who George had earlier deduced was being held captive in a nearby village. Samuel stops them, shooting and killing Leti and seriously wounding George. Atticus agrees to cooperate in the ritual to save their lives, but the magic backfires as a black woman in a 19th-century dress appears (implied to be Atticus's slave ancestor), turning Samuel and the other Sons to stone and burning down the mansion. Atticus escapes, only to discover that although Leti has been resurrected, George has succumbed to his wounds."},
  {id: 3, title: "Holy Ghost", description: " Three weeks after George's funeral, Leti uses an unexpected inheritance from her deceased mother to buy a dilapidated Victorian mansion in an all-white neighborhood on Chicago's North Side, filling it with black renters together with her half-sister Ruby. The white neighbors harass them and burn a cross on the lawn. A white supremacist police officer, Captain Lancaster, threatens Leti. Inside the house, supernatural activity flares up. Leti learns that the previous owner was a white scientist, Hiram Epstein. With the help of Lancaster, he kidnapped, experimented on, and killed eight black people before burying them under the house. All nine spirits are trapped there. With the help of a medium and the black spirits, Leti banishes Epstein's malevolent ghost. Later, Atticus finds Christina Braithwhite in Chicago; she survived the fire. Atticus has deduced that she was secretly the source of the 'inheritance' and had steered Leti to the house. Christina explains that the house was built by Horatio Winthrop, a Sons of Adam member banished after stealing pages from The Book of Names in the 1800s, and that Epstein was a follower of Winthrop's. She asks Atticus to help her find the missing pages, which could help decipher 'the language of Adam'. Atticus attempts to shoot her, but he is not able to pull the trigger."},
  {id: 4, title: "A History of Violence", description: " Montrose learns that Titus Braithwhite's pages from the Book of Names are stored in a vault in a museum in Boston where Braithwhite donated a wing dedicated to his career as an explorer. Montrose tries to hide this information from Tic, as he wants his son to stop pursuing magic, but he eventually relents and goes with Tic and Leti to the museum. They break into the vault after hours and find a desiccated corpse bent over the pages. When Tic tries to take them, the corpse reanimates into an Arawak Two-Spirit named Yahima. Yahima tell Tic that Braithwhite kidnapped them and locked them in the vault after they translated the pages for him. They agree to leave with the Chicago travelers, but the vault begins to flood, and the four barely escape. Upon returning to Chicago, Montrose murders Yahima to keep them from revealing more information about the pages. Meanwhile, Sheriff Lancaster and Christina vie over control of the Chicago Sons of Adam lodge, William seduces Ruby, and Hippolyta and Diana go in search of answers about George's death."},
  {id: 5, title: "Strange Case", description: " After sleeping with William, Ruby wakes up as a white woman and William reveals to her his metamorphosis potion. Montrose tells Atticus that he has taken care of Yahima and destroyed the pages, causing his son to nearly beat him to death. Leti tells Atticus that she is afraid of his anger, but the two later reconcile and have sex. Montrose goes to Sammy's apartment and has sex with him. As Tic works on deciphering the 'Language of Adam' from Leti's photos, Leti warns him that the use of magic is inherently evil and will corrupt him. Ruby decides to keep using the potion for its privilege and gets a job as an associate manager at the department store under the name of Hillary. William tells her that she must perform a 'favor' for Christina by planting a runic stone in Captain Lancaster's office. While doing so, she discovers an imprisoned man who has been tortured and learns that the sheriff has a partially black body. Later, Ruby witnesses her white boss, Paul, attempt to sexually assault Tamara. After Christina tells Ruby to embrace power, Ruby rapes Paul with a stiletto heel. Ruby confronts William and asks what he and Christina do in the basement and William metamorphoses into Christina. As Atticus works on the language, he translates something that causes him to call his former lover, Ji-Ah, in South Korea."},
  {id: 6, title: "Meet Me in Daegu", description: " In 1949 South Korea, Ji-Ah studies to be a nurse and lives with her mother who demands she pick up men to have sex with. Ji-Ah brings home a man and kills him with her tentacle-like 'Nine Tails' that project out of her body. It is revealed that Ji-Ah is possessed by a kumiho, the 'Nine-tailed Fox' spirit and she must kill 100 men to be human again. Her stepfather was raping her, and her mother had a shaman send the kumiho to possess her daughter to kill him. In 1950, the Korean War begins and Ji-Ah works as a nurse. To smoke out a Communist spy, the Americans arrest the nurses and Atticus executes one of the nurses. Ji-Ah's friend Young-Ja reveals herself to be the spy. Ji-Ah decides to seduce Atticus with the intention of killing him, but falls in love with him instead. Ji-Ah believes she can control her 'Tails', but while having sex with Atticus, her 'tails' emerge and attack him. She has a vision of his future and tells him he will die if he returns to America. Atticus ends the relationship. Ji-Ah and her mother consult the shaman who tells them that many more will die."},
  {id: 7, title: "I Am.", description: " Hippolyta visits the ruins of the Ardham Lodge and discovers that George was there. She works out how to use the orrery and finds a key hidden within. Christina shows Ruby the corpse of William (who was killed by Lancaster) and Dell, and asks for her help. Leti and Atticus discover that they are both having dreams of Hanna (Atticus's slave ancestor) and deduce that she escaped with the Book of Names. Atticus discovers his father's homosexuality while Leti finds she is pregnant. Atticus goes to St. Louis to contact a relative and is told the Book of Names was lost in the Tulsa race massacre of 1921. Hippolyta goes to the Winthrop observatory and uses the key.

  {id: 8, title: "Jig-A-Bobo", description: " Atticus, Leti, Ruby, Montrose and Diana attend the memorial for Emmett Till (who was a friend of Diana's). Diana is stopped by Lancaster who demands she give him the orrery and when she refuses, he casts a spell that leads to two malevolent spirits, Topsy and Bopsy, to haunt her. Atticus gives Christina the key to the orrery/time machine in exchange for learning how to cast spells. Christina is planning to sacrifice Atticus at the fall equinox to be immortal. Ruby grows closer to Christina, but is hurt when she tells her that she does not care about Till's lynching. Ji-Ah arrives in Chicago, causing Leti to become angry with Atticus. Montrose and Atticus reconcile. Atticus says he visited the future while at the Winthrop observatory and will have a son by Leti named George who will write the book Lovecraft Country. Leti trades the negatives of her photos in exchange for Christina casting a spell. Montrose and Atticus cast a spell to protect them, but nothing happens. Two men kill Christina in the same manner as Till and dump her corpse into Lake Michigan, but she revives. A suddenly more appreciative Ruby tells Leti of her relationship with William / Christina. Diana is attacked by Topsy and Bopsy and collapses. Lancaster attempts to enter Leti's house to find the orrery, but when he cannot, he and his policemen shoot up the house. A policeman tries to shoot Atticus, but a shoggoth appears who kills the policemen and tears off Lancaster's arm. Leti observes that Atticus's spell worked after all."},
  {id: 9, title: "Rewind 1921", description: " Hippolyta returns to Chicago to find Atticus, Leti and Montrose struggling to keep Diana alive after her being cursed by Lancaster. Ruby summons Christina, who uses Hippolyta's blood to 'reset' the curse but warns that because Lancaster was the only one who knew the curse, it cannot be fully lifted. Christina visits and taunts a dying Lancaster and convinces Ruby to aid her in her quest for immortality, even after Ruby learns that the spell will kill Tic. The others decide to use Hiram's multiverse machine to travel back in time to 1921 Tulsa, where Tic's mother's family held the Book of Names before it was destroyed in the Tulsa race massacre.
